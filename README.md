# Enhanced Document Query Speed and Relevance-Based Document Presentation

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a project aimed at improving document query speed and presenting search results by order of relevance. The project addresses a common challenge in information retrieval, particularly in the context of web applications, where users expect rapid and meaningful responses to their queries.

## Problem Statement

Retrieving documents based solely on query terms can become slow and inefficient, especially when dealing with a large number of documents. Furthermore, presenting these documents in a way that reflects their relevance to the query is essential for a positive user experience.

## Objective and Impact

The primary objective of this project is to enhance the speed at which documents are retrieved in response to user queries and to ensure that the retrieved documents are presented in order of relevance. Achieving this objective has a significant impact on the responsiveness of end-user applications, particularly web applications, where timely results are crucial.

## Implementation Approach

To address this problem, a solution is implemented that combines the power of PostgreSQL and Python text processing libraries, such as NLTK. The core techniques employed include term-frequency (tf-idf) calculations and the use of PostgreSQL's built-in ts-rank for document-ranking. Additionally, a dictionary data structure is implemented to efficiently index query terms to their corresponding documents.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the installation and usage instructions provided in the documentation. Detailed guides on setting up the environment, running queries, and customizing the relevance-based document presentation are available.
